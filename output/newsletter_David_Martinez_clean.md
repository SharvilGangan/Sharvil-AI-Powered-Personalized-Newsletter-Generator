- [Apollo 13 Launch: 55 Years Ago](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/apollo-13-launch-55-years-ago/)
  > **Apollo 13 Launch: 55 Years Ago**  In 1970, five astronauts embarked on a daring mission to the moon, Apollo 13. The
crew faced a life-threatening situation when an oxygen tank ruptured 55 hours and 55 minutes into the journey. Faced
with an impossible task, they had to abandon the planned lunar landing and embark on a perilous loop around the moon.
This unprecedented mission showcased the resilience and ingenuity of the astronauts and the scientific ingenuity that
propelled humanity to the moon.

- [NASA’s IMAP Arrives at NASA Marshall For Testing in XRCF](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasas-imap-arrives-at-nasa-marshall-for-testing-in-xrcf/)
  > **NASA's IMAP Arrives at NASA Marshall For Thermal Vacuum Testing in XRCF**  NASA's IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and
Acceleration Probe) arrived at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for thermal vacuum testing at
the X-ray and Cryogenic Facility (XRCF). The IMAP mission is a modern-day celestial cartographer that will map the solar
system by studying the heliosphere, a region beyond Earth's atmosphere that is filled with charged particles and
magnetic fields.

- [Author Correction: Sulfide-rich continental roots at cratonic margins formed by carbonated melts](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08911-5)
  > The article discusses the formation of sulfide-rich continental roots at the margins of
ancient volcanic provinces. It highlights the presence of carbonated melts, suggesting that the roots formed through the
interaction between magma and water. The roots, formed by the solidification of carbonated fluids, are estimated to be
around 1.5 billion years old and provide insights into the early history of the Earth.

- [Mystery of medieval manuscripts revealed by ancient DNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01108-w)
  > Medieval manuscripts have puzzled historians with their intricate and intricate bindings. A
new study reveals that the covers of these books may be made of sealskin, indicating long-distance trade networks and
cultural exchange between distant regions.

- [Liquids in a glass recover a graceful shape even after being shaken](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01109-9)
  > A team of scientists has discovered that liquids in a glass can recover their graceful shape
even after being shaken. The liquid is composed of oil and water with magnetic nickel particles. The particles align
themselves to create a shape that resembles a Grecian urn, regardless of the orientation of the glass.

- [NIH cuts triggered a host of lawsuits: <i>Nature’</i>s guide to what’s next](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01192-y)
  > Sure, here is a summary of the news article:  A recent article published in Nature reveals that numerous lawsuits have
been filed in response to the Trump administration's termination of various grants. These lawsuits aim to overturn the
terminations and seek compensation for the lost funding.

- [Physicists narrow down neutrino’s mysterious mass](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01157-1)
  > **Physicists Narrow Down Neutrino's Mysterious Mass**  A new experiment has shed light on the mysterious mass of
neutrinos, the hypothetical particles that are believed to play a crucial role in the universe's energy production. A
team of scientists from the University of Oxford has reported that neutrinos are at least one million times lighter than
electrons. This finding challenges previous estimates of neutrino mass and opens up new avenues for research in particle
physics.
