<p><strong>OpenAI Bot Abuse: 4 Months of Spammy Messages</strong>  A chatbot developed by OpenAI was used by spammers to plaster 80,000
websites with messages that evaded spam filters. Despite the company's knowledge of the issue, they failed to detect the
malicious activity for four months.  The bot, designed to assist with marketing tasks, generated the spam content, which
targeted a range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. The spam was not only annoying but could
potentially damage the reputation of the target organizations.  The incident highlights the importance of monitoring and
mitigating chatbot abuse. OpenAI must take steps to ensure that its AI systems are used responsibly and ethically.</p>

<h2>Tech Tariffs: A Temporary Boon for the Industry?  U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has announced that consumer</h2>

comes despite the recent postponement of many of the tariffs due to trade negotiations.  This exemption is expected to
provide some relief for the tech industry, as it could help to lower the cost of these essential devices and improve
market access. However, it is important to note that this is a temporary measure and the industry remains vulnerable to
future tariff hikes.</p>

<h2>That groan you hear is users’ reaction to Recall going back into Windows  The article describes a strange and</h2>
<p>peculiar phenomenon that's been reported by Windows users: a gradual increase in the "groan" noise users hear when the
system transitions back to Windows from an AI-powered screenshot and AI processing session. The sound, described as a
"low-pitched groan," has become a running joke among Windows users, with some even calling it the "Windows groan."  The
reason for this odd occurrence is not yet fully understood, but it's believed to be related to the process of capturing
and processing the screen during the transition back to Windows. The rapid snapshotting and AI processing can cause a
slight delay or stutter in the system's transition, leading to the eerie groan sound.</p>

<h2>Researcher Uncovers Dozens of Sketchy Chrome Extensions with 4 Million Installs  An investigation by the</h2>
<p>cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes revealed dozens of Chrome extensions with misleading or suspicious names and icons.
These extensions, which have garnered over 4 million installations, displayed positive "Featured" marks on Google's
extension store, despite posing potential security risks.  The extensions, ranging from simple password managers to more
complex financial monitoring tools, were found to contain malware, including keyloggers, trackers, and other malicious
software. This raises concerns about the deceptive nature of the "Featured" badge and the ease with which users can be
misled into installing such dangerous software.  The study also highlights the challenge of combating malware
proliferation within the Chrome Web Store, as even seemingly trustworthy extensions can be infected. This incident
serves as a reminder of the need for increased vigilance and security measures for developers and users alike.</p>
