  > **JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon Warns of Treasury Market 'Kerfuffle' That Could Force Fed to Intervene**  JPMorgan Chase CEO
Jamie Dimon has expressed deep concern over the potential for a "kerfuffle" in the US Treasury market that could force
the Federal Reserve to intervene. A kerfuffle, in this context, refers to a situation where multiple large participants
disagree on a price, causing prices to fluctuate wildly.  Dimon expressed his fears during a congressional hearing,
highlighting the interconnectedness of the global economy and the risk of a financial domino effect. He warned that any
major disruption in the Treasury market could have a significant impact on the overall economy, including higher
borrowing costs, reduced investment, and potential job losses.  The Federal Reserve has maintained a tight monetary
policy to combat inflation, but Dimon's warning suggests that this approach may be losing its effectiveness. The US
economy has shown signs of resilience in recent months, but concerns remain about the sustainability of this growth.
