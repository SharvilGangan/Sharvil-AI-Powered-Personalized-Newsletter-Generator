<blockquote>
<p><strong>Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Buy After Strategy's $7.69 Billion Q1 Buying Spree</strong>  Saylor, the CEO of the crypto exchange
firm Strategy, has hinted at a potential new Bitcoin purchase in the future. In a recent interview, Saylor confirmed
that the company is actively monitoring market conditions and may consider buying Bitcoin if the right opportunity
arises.  The news comes as Strategy's Q1 earning statement revealed that the company had purchased a significant amount
of Bitcoin during the quarter. Saylor's statement suggests that the company is likely to continue its aggressive Bitcoin
buying spree in the near future.  The news has sparked debate among crypto industry experts, with some analysts
predicting a Bitcoin purchase, while others remain skeptical. However, it is clear that Saylor's company is closely
watching the market and is prepared to act when the right conditions are met.</p>

<p><strong>JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon Warns of Treasury Market 'Kerfuffle' That Could Force Fed to Intervene</strong>  JPMorgan Chase CEO
Jamie Dimon has expressed deep concern over the potential for a "kerfuffle" in the US Treasury market that could force
the Federal Reserve to intervene. A kerfuffle, in this context, refers to a situation where multiple large participants
disagree on a price, causing prices to fluctuate wildly.  Dimon expressed his fears during a congressional hearing,
highlighting the interconnectedness of the global economy and the risk of a financial domino effect. He warned that any
major disruption in the Treasury market could have a significant impact on the overall economy, including higher
borrowing costs, reduced investment, and potential job losses.  The Federal Reserve has maintained a tight monetary
policy to combat inflation, but Dimon's warning suggests that this approach may be losing its effectiveness. The US
economy has shown signs of resilience in recent months, but concerns remain about the sustainability of this growth.</p>
