- [That groan you hear is users’ reaction to Recall going back into Windows](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/microsoft-is-putting-privacy-endangering-recall-back-into-windows-11/)
  > ## That groan you hear is users’ reaction to Recall going back into Windows  The article describes a strange and
peculiar phenomenon that's been reported by Windows users: a gradual increase in the "groan" noise users hear when the
system transitions back to Windows from an AI-powered screenshot and AI processing session. The sound, described as a
"low-pitched groan," has become a running joke among Windows users, with some even calling it the "Windows groan."  The
reason for this odd occurrence is not yet fully understood, but it's believed to be related to the process of capturing
and processing the screen during the transition back to Windows. The rapid snapshotting and AI processing can cause a
slight delay or stutter in the system's transition, leading to the eerie groan sound.

- [Researcher uncovers dozens of sketchy Chrome extensions with 4 million installs](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/researcher-uncovers-dozens-of-sketchy-chrome-extensions-with-4-million-installs/)
  > ## Researcher Uncovers Dozens of Sketchy Chrome Extensions with 4 Million Installs  An investigation by the
cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes revealed dozens of Chrome extensions with misleading or suspicious names and icons.
These extensions, which have garnered over 4 million installations, displayed positive "Featured" marks on Google's
extension store, despite posing potential security risks.  The extensions, ranging from simple password managers to more
complex financial monitoring tools, were found to contain malware, including keyloggers, trackers, and other malicious
software. This raises concerns about the deceptive nature of the "Featured" badge and the ease with which users can be
misled into installing such dangerous software.  The study also highlights the challenge of combating malware
proliferation within the Chrome Web Store, as even seemingly trustworthy extensions can be infected. This incident
serves as a reminder of the need for increased vigilance and security measures for developers and users alike.
